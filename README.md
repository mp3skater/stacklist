## How to use

To compile this program I'd recommend to use a linux distro with [gcc](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/), but you can also use [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) for windows or an IDE like Vim/Emacs or VCS for Windows and MacOS.
The rules to compile the different Test-programs are in the makefile.

With these commands you should be able to execute the test program in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/mp3skater/stacklist.git`

`make run`
